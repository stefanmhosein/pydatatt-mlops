# Requirements:
Ideally you will want to create a virtual environment
* [option 1 (python's default)](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html)
* [option 2 (conda)](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html)
* [option 3 (pyenv: recommended)](https://realpython.com/intro-to-pyenv/#virtual-environments-and-pyenv). I have tested this with Python 3.7.12.

Once you have your virtual enviornment set up you need to install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
